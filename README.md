# Email verification

Verify an email address before allowing a user to create an account on Backdrop.

This module makes sure that the email address used in account creation has a valid inbox.

The person filling out the registration form will be required to receive a verification
code to the email address they provided and provide that code in the registration form
before they are allowed to create a user account.
